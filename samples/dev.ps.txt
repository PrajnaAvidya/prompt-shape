I'm developing a templating engine in TS called PromptShape for efficient text-based gpt prompting. Here's my WIP readme/spec so far:

{{@load("README.md")}}

I'm using PEG.js for the parser and here's the source code for the inline variable parser:

{{@load("src/template-parser.pegjs")}}
===
Here's the current source code for the TS parser:

{{@load("src/parser.ts")}}
===
Here's the functions.ts file

{{@load("src/functions.ts")}}
===
Here's my types

{{@load("src/types.ts")}}

I would like some help developing it further.

I'm currently writing tests for everything. a few of them:

{{@load("test/slots.spec.ts")}}
{{@load("test/single-line-variables.spec.ts"}}
{{@load("test/multi-line-variables.spec.ts"}}
{{@load("test/functions.spec.ts"}}

Can you write the tests for nested-tags.spec.ts
Please include both the tests and the templates for them
