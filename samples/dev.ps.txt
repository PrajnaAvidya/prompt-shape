I'm developing a templating engine in TS called PromptShape for efficient text-based gpt prompting. Here's my WIP readme/spec so far:

{spec = load("spec.md")}
{{@spec}}
===
I'm using PEG.js for the parser and here's the source code for the inline variable parser:

{pegParser = load("src/parsers/slots-variables.pegjs")}
{{@pegParser}}
===
Here's the current source code for the TS parser:

{tsParser = load("src/parser.ts")}
{{@tsParser}}
===
I would like some help developing it further.
