I'm developing a templating engine in TS called PromptShape for efficient text-based gpt prompting. Here's my WIP readme/spec so far:

{currentQuestion}
I want to redo the parser in PEG.js. please write the code to match my new variable format:
{variableName = value}

where variableName starts with a letter and contains any combo of letters, numbers, and underscores
value is either a double quoted string e.g. "testValue" or an unquoted number e.g. 5 or 55.5, or value can be a function of the format functionName(params) where functionName obeys the same rules as variableName and params is a list of string and numeric params separated by commas

It should support arbitrary whitespace between elements but it should only be on a single line (no newline chars allowed using this inline definition)

Here's the source code for the parser:

I would like some help developing it further.
