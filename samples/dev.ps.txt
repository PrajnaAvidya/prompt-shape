I'm developing a templating engine in TS called PromptShape for efficient text-based gpt prompting. Here's my WIP readme/spec so far:

{currentQuestion}
I want to redo and improve how single bracket variables are defined. First, how do I only parse single bracket variable tags that are not surrounded by other single bracket tags in the current template?

{{@spec}}

{parser = "parser.ts"}
{{@parser}}

I would like some help developing it further. {{@currentQuestion}}
