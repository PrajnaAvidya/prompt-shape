// TODO how to append

// TODO what steps to take in compilation?
// first get/validate all snippet definitions, error if there are unmatched opening or closing tags
// then remove those from the page (and comments)
// then check for collection defs, load them (error if referencing unknown snippets) and then remove those from the page
// then render collections
// then render all variables (will need to be called recursively because snippets can contain vars)
// then we're done? (no we still need to run the gpt query)

// next step is then to put the result of a template render+gpt call into a snippet for dynamic use
// so if I have a collection of book chapters I need a syntax to run a prompt on each one and then join the results into a single piece of text

This is the prompt that will be sent to gpt
