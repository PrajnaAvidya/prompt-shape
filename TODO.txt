TOP PRIORITY
- collections

tests
- whitespace
- recursion limit

syntax/error checking
- check for unpaired multilines (or just ignore them?)
- check for incorrect nesting of multilines eg {a} {b} {/a} {/b}
- check for optional params before required

collection stuff? (low priority until I actually need them)
- decide on best syntax. probably this:
{collectionVar[] = 1, "two", 3.14, anotherVarName, varNameWithParams("hello"), functionName("test.txt",1)}
I played with multiline collection var tags and don't like it, better off using json vars if you want to get fancy
- basic iterating
- validate the names of collection vars
- make collection variable name accessible in the loop
- index access
- appending
- for loops?

nice to haves
- use variable or function as param
- partial file load (e.g. optional start/end line params for load. except that sucks for when files change, what if there's a symbol start/escape sequence type thing?)
- tag for making gpt calls e.g. %gpt% (do they need an option to be deferred vs instant)
-- ability to save gpt call response to a variable
-- placeholders for responses -- i.e. as it scans down the file you can define a thing where it executes up until there and then captures the response and either adds it as another chatgpt message, or captures it into a variable
- python style named params
- better messages for syntax errors
- param to show filename with load() (ie the resulting variable/value contains the file name and surrounding blocks to separate it)
- syntax highlighting for .ps.txt in IDEs
- params for inline variables e.g. {rectArea(length, width)=multiply(length, width)}
- parse multiple files or a directory
-- load directory into a collection
- option to trim the leading \n from multiline vars (should this happen by default?)
- option to put result into user's clipboard
