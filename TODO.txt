TOP PRIORITY
- arithmetic between any combo of numbers/vars/functions
- finish tests
- hook into an openai library and auto-send the response & save that somewhere
- build/infra stuff to make it usable without downloading repo
-- and github workflow stuff (run tests, check types, lint, etc)

syntax/error checking
- check for unpaired multilines (or just ignore them?)
- check for incorrect nesting of multilines eg {a} {b} {/a} {/b}
- check for optional params before required

collection stuff? (low priority until I actually need them)
- decide on best syntax
- basic iterating
- validate the names of collection vars
- make collection variable name accessible in the loop
- index access
- appending
- for loops?

ux stuff
- what's my ideal workflow? user could either use npx or install it globally and run command line.
- I want something easily triggered from an IDE, so probably linked to a macro
- by default it should just output to buffer so it can be redirected or saved or whatever
- how do I have it get the result into the user's clipboard or whatever way to get it into their gpt client the fastest?
- make it run a web server able to receive snippets of text from the browser or other sources (what would be the best way to hook into something like github to assign a file to a var?)

nice to haves
- use variable or function as param
- file variables with parameters -- more specifically, allow parameters to be passed when calling load()
- partial file load (e.g. optional start/end line params for load. except that sucks for when files change, what if there's a symbol start/escape sequence type thing?)
- tag for making gpt calls e.g. %gpt% (do they need an option to be deferred vs instant)
- ability to save gpt call response to a var
- placeholders for responses -- i.e. as it scans down the file you can define a thing where it executes up until there and then captures the response and either adds it as another chatgpt message, or captures it into a variable
- operators could just be registered aliases for functions, so they could be extended/customized
- python style named params
- configurable tag char for people who don't like {}
- better messages for syntax errors
- option to show filename when rendering from load()
- option to allow absolute/parent paths for template file load (for security)
