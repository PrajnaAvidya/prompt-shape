improve clarity of slot definition vs variable, maybe they should just be called different things
collections/iterating
basic for loops (can we just iterate a collection for all cases or is this actually needed?)
load/run template from a file from within a template
gpt calls - do they need an option to be deferred vs instant?
should there be some option/setting to separate snippets by == or not? (e.g. when iterating a collection)
