how to save default/stored prefs for multiple requests? so you could do something like --profile blah instead of 6 different options. also defaults for certain options? being able to change default model would be nice

nice to haves
- something similar to the {{gen}} tag in microsoft guidance so running prompts can be part of processing a template
- tag for making gpt calls e.g. %gpt% (do they need an option to be deferred vs instant)
-- ability to save gpt call response to a variable
-- placeholders for responses -- i.e. as it scans down the file you can define a thing where it executes up until there and then captures the response and either adds it as another chatgpt message, or captures it into a variable
- partial file load (e.g. optional start/end line params for load. except that sucks for when files change, what if there's a symbol start/escape sequence type thing?)
- params for inline variables e.g. {rectArea(length, width)=multiply(length, width)}
- parse multiple files or a directory
-- load directory into a collection
- option to trim the leading \n from multiline vars (should this happen by default?)

collections? (low priority until I actually need them)
- decide on best syntax. probably this: {collectionVar[] = 1, "two", 3.14, anotherVarName, varNameWithParams("hello"), functionName("test.txt",1)}
- I played with multiline collection var tags and don't like it, better off using json vars if you want to get fancy
- basic iterating
- validate the names of collection vars
- make collection variable name accessible in the loop
- index access
- appending
- for loops?
