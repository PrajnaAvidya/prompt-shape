TOP PRIORITY
- finish redoing in peg
-- nested tags & recursive render
-- arithmetic
-- syntax for outputting a function directly instead of loading to var: e.g. {load("file.txt")} or {@anotherFunction("foobar", 3.33)}
-- support for escaped quotes & brackets
- use variable as param
- check for unpaired multilines (or just ignore them?)
- check for incorrect nesting of multilines eg {a} {b} {/a} {/b}
- granular test files and an automated suite to run them (each individual feature, error condition, etc)

config
- allow absolute/parent paths for template file load (for security)
- show debug messages

collection stuff? (low priority until I actually need them)
- pull collection stuff into a new branch until its ready
- decide on best syntax
- basic iterating
- validate the names of collection vars
- make collection variable name accessible
- index access
- appending
- for loops?

nice to haves
- file variables with parameters
- partial file load (e.g. start/end line optional params for load)
- tag for making gpt calls e.g. %gpt% (do they need an option to be deferred vs instant)
- render against a json hash (handlebars style) instead of inline/loaded variables

other random cool ideas
- placeholders for responses -- i.e. as it scans down the file you can define a thing where it executes up until there and then captures the response and either adds it as another chatgpt message, or captures it into a variable

if I were to use this to aid myself in writing this very app what would I need?
- loading variables from files (params not needed) -- for including code/text samples
-- is this really it? I don't think I need collections, are they more useful for writing? I guess I can have a collection of code samples
- ability to auto feed final output to gpt. I should look into using an existing openai library, no need to write my own thing for that.
