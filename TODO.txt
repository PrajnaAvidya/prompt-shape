use variable as param
do isNumeric on trimmed inline templates to see if they should be numbers

REDO RENDERING SO ITS FULLY RECURSIVE (starts at the top level and works down template/collection definitions and renders like a tree)

improve clarity of slot definition vs variable, maybe they should just be called different things
collections/iterating
basic for loops (can we just iterate a collection for all cases or is this actually needed?)
load/run template from a file from within a template
gpt calls - do they need an option to be deferred vs instant?
should there be some option/setting to separate snippets by == or not? (e.g. when iterating a collection)
look for name conflicts
validate the names of collection vars
